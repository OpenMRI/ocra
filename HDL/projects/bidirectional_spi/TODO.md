Important issues remaining on this core
- [ ] Reading doesn't shift into correct bits (off by one) (not done)
- [ ] To fabric FIFO transfer does not finnish due to possible reset (not done)
- [ ] Asserts in testbench (not done)
- [ ] inout doesn't work in test bench (not done)
- [ ] correct bitlengths for transaction length and bitcounters (not done)
- [ ] remove dual clock approach and replace with simple single clock
